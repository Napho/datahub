## [Buiding on top of next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

- The file system is your routes. Drop a new file in pages and it becomes a route
- Automatic code splitting at route level


## [On why we chose flow for types](https://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/2016_hhjs.html#/27)
- Types make code more mantainable and easier to reason about.

## state management and data fetching with [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- Apollo graphql integration takes away alot of data fetching boilerplate commonly found in react apps. 
- Apollo graphql also alows for effeicient data fetching through fewer network requests.
