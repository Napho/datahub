# For end to end tests

Notes
--------

We add a `data-cy` attribute to elements we want to interactively test with cypress, say form inputs or clicks.
You can have a look at this [issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1212#issuecomment-360395261)  and  [cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Selecting-Elements) for more info.
