# For end to end tests

You can access our tests details from the [cypress dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/#/organizations/dab40b78-b24e-4f1c-913a-0a0b8bd0c71a/projects)

Notes
--------

We add a `data-cy` attribute to elements we want to interactively test with cypress, say form inputs or clicks.
You can have a look at this [issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1212#issuecomment-360395261)  and  [cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Selecting-Elements) for more info.
